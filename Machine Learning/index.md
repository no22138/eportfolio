In this module, we will use the Python programming language to support the design and development of object oriented programs. The object oriented analysis and design process will be supported using the Unified Modelling Language (UML). The four major features of object oriented programs will be examined, which include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop an object oriented program using Python.
- Prepare UML models to support the object oriented design process.
- Apply data structures to support the storage of data in a variety of ways.
- Implement data search algorithms to process stored data in the most efficient approaches.
- Use design patterns to organise code contributing to an individual system.
