## Summary
<div align="justify">
 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution has exerted a substantial impact on surveillance methodologies, providing governments with powerful instruments for national and international security (Schwab, 2016). However,
the pervasive deployment of surveillance technologies has recently raised ethical and legal concerns regarding privacy, governance, and security.

In 2021, the Amnesty International revealed that several thousand political leaders, human rights workers, and journalists were under the widespread surveillance by a spyware called “Pegasus” which was developed by NSO, an Israel based tech surveillance company. The findings disclosed that Pegasus infiltrated smartphones, enabling unauthorized access to diverse functionalities such as the camera, microphone, contacts, call logs, web browsing history, text messages, photos, videos, settings, and location info. Furthermore, it was reported that Pegasus global operations were conducted in 45 countries (Citizen Lab, 2018).

The Pegasus spyware scandal, specifically targeting journalists, human rights defenders, and politicians pointed out to the potential misuse by government authorities and the potential consequences. Although advanced technologies can enhance the efficiency of surveillance systems, making it easier for authorities to monitor and respond to security threats promptly, this incident showed the risk of potential weaponization of such surveillance tools by the state authorities against individuals or groups for the sake of extensive political control (Kaldani &amp; Prokopets, 2023).

The rapid evolution of technology has frequently outpaced the establishment of adequate legal and regulatory frameworks (Schwab, 2016). This creates a situation where there is a lack of transparency and oversight concerning the development and utilization of digital surveillance tools by public authorities. The creation and implementation of these surveillance technologies should be accompanied by legal safeguards (legal and regulatory measures) to prevent privacy violations and misuse of technology by public authorities against the targeted individuals or groups for specific political agenda.
