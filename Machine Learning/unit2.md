#Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): an approach for summarizing, visualizing, and becoming intimately familiar with the important characteristics of a data set.

## EDA methods:
+ Univariate visualization: summary statistics for each field
+ Bivariate visualization:  relationship between each variable
+ Multivariate visualization:  interactions between different fields
+ Dimensionality reduction : the fields in the data that account for the most variance between observations
