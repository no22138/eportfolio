# Correlation and Regression

## Correlation 
Correlation aims to find the degree of relationship between two variables.
A scatter plot is the best method to visually represent the relationship between two variables.

Positive correlation: Both variables change in the same direction.
Negative correlation: Variables change in opposite directions.
Neutral: No relationship 

## Correlation vs Causation

Correlation does not mean causation, although they might exist at the same time.

## Quantifying Correlation

+ Covariance
+ Pearson Correlation Coefficient
+ Dependent variable
+ Independent variable

## Regression

Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used to estimate relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
