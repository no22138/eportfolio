## Correlation and Regression

Correlation

A scatter plot is the best method to visually represent the relationship between two variables.
<u>Positive correlation: Both variables change in the same direction.
<u>Negative correlation: Variables change in opposite directions.
<u>Neutral: No relationship 

## Correlation vs Causation
