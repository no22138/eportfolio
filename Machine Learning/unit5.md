# Clustering
+ Clustering: A set of techniques used to partition data into groups, or clusters.
+ Euclidiean Distance: It is used to calculate the linear distance between two points.
+ Simple Matching Coefficient: It is used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets. is the total number of attributes where A has value 1 and B has value 0.
+ Cosine Similarity: It measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space.
+ K-Means clustering: K means clustering, assigns data points to one of the K clusters depending on their distance from the center of the clusters.
