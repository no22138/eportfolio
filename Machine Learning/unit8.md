# Collaborative Discussion 2- Legal and Ethical views on ANN applications

## Discussion Topic
Read/listen to the [article by Hutson (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00530-0) in Nature on Robo-writers. This week, post your thoughts on the risks and benefits of the use AI writers at different levels, from administrative work to creative writing.

## Summary
ChatGPT-3, based on a large language model, was trained on approximately 200 billion words (Hutson, 2021). It was was trained on a large dataset which included websites, articles, books etc. This raises some legal and ethical concerns regarding whether these complex systems are trained on works with copyright and whether this can be considered copyright infringement in legal terms. 

There have been numerous appeals by the copyright owners in the past year. For example, Universal Music Group appealed that these systems violated copyright law because copyrighted songs were used in training data (Sato, 2023). Similarly, the New York Times sued the OpenAI  (APA News, 2023) for using its web articles to train its chatbots. 

The copyright law provides authors and artists exclusive rights to control the use of their work. However these authors and artists who are the “copyright owners” are not compensated when their work are used by the developers to train AI systems. In their reply to the US Patent Office, the OpenAI admitted that they trained their programme with “large, publicly available datasets that include copyrighted works” (PTO, 2019). The working principle of these generative AI tools challenge the legal aspect of copyright protection. This causes the authors and artists to fear that they lose control over their creative work, and the fact that these AI tools can replicate patterns and generate similar works may cause the creative community to lose a considerable revenue in the coming years.

It is important to point out that the generative AI tools must be  developed ethically and responsibly and to avoid infringing the copyright owners. One of the solutions can be implementation of more transparent training policies by the companies. Another solution can be obtaining permission from the copyright owners and/or compensate them for using their work for training dataset.
