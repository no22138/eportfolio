Hi! This is Nâ€™s e-portfolio for MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex. 

I have been working in International Organizations for the past 7 years. I have been responsible for project management and reporting for multi-country projects in the field of human rights and sustainable development.

I decided to pursue MSc in Artificial Intelligence program upon observing a gap between ethics and engineering communities, and a lack of technical knowledge within the current AI ethics discourse in the standard-setting Organizations.

I am in the process of building a multidisciplinary profile in AI, policy analysis, law, and ethics. I hope to gain a better understanding of the technical challenges, possibilities, and opportunities; and to have the technical expertise to help my Organization in shaping its way of perceiving the AI technology.
