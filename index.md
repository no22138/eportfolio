# Nâ€™s E-portfolio  
MSc in Artificial Intelligence in UoE Online.

## About me
I am a civil servant working in International Organizations doing project management and reporting for cooperation projects in the field of human rights and sustainable development.

I am in the process of building a multidisciplinary profile in AI, policy analysis, law, and ethics. I hope to gain a better understanding of the technical challenges, risks, and opportunities; and to have the necessary technical expertise to contribute to my Organization's work in this field.
