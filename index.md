# Nâ€™s E-portfolio  
MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex

## About me
I have been working in International Organizations for the past 7 years. I have been responsible for project management and reporting for multi-country projects in the field of human rights and sustainable development.

I am in the process of building a multidisciplinary profile in AI, policy analysis, law, and ethics. I hope to gain a better understanding of the technical challenges, possibilities, and opportunities; and to have the necessary technical expertise to help my Organization's work in regulating the AI technology.
